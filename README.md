*A Comparative Analysis of two Evolutionary Algorithms in the EVOMAN Framework*

Under the Evoman framework, we test, analyze, and compare the fitness of two algorithms: one based on standard genetic algorithm (GA) and one based on a modified GA, across three enemies(1, 2, 3) of the Evoman game.

Evoman is a video game playing framework used as a testbed for optimization algorithms. A demo can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqaMjd1E4ZI
